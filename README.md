# Significance of Fans
## Brief history
The first electric fan was created by *Dr. Schuyler Skaats Wheeler in 1886.* It was a small, two-blade personal desk fan that was DC powered. Made of brass and loved by all who worked inside in the summer, the fan was modern, effective, and dangerous as there was no cage surrounding the blades

Today’s electric fans are still a very popular solution to overcome the heat. Portable fans, whether it be the personal desk fan or a small battery powered fan that you can carry on hot summer days, make it convenient to keep cool.

Ceiling fans are also an effective method for circulating air in the summer, but can also be used to circulate warm air in the winter by changing the direction of the blade. Fans without visible blades are the newest innovation in air circulation.And because of his invention many filipino people today survive the hot weather because of this simple machine.

## Evolution of Fans
Fans have existed for over a millennium. Egyptians used lotus leaves as fans. Greeks and Romans liked peacock feathers. The electrical fan was introduced in 1882 and has evolved over time.

Let’s look at how one of the most essential electrical wonder has evolved over a period of time.

• **1734** – Frenchman John Theophilus Desagulier invents the paddle fan to ventilate mines.

• **1882** – Schuyler Skaats Wheeler invents the electric fan taking help of the infant science of electricity. He invented the desktop fan with two blaes.

• **1889** – Philip H. Diehl patents the ceiling fan after he mounted a fan blade on sewing machine motor and installing the whole unit on the ceiling.

• **1894** – German professor Hermann Rietchel publishes Guide to Calculating and Design of Ventilation and Heating Installations.

• **1896** – Fans with more than two blades are produced.

• **1904** – Oscillating fan debuts when Diehl and Co put a split-ball joint on the ceiling fan allowing it to be redirected.

• **1910** – Westinghouse marketing an electric fan for household use claiming that electricity usage would cost one-fourth of a penny per hour.

• **1934** – Self-contained window fans using plastic instead of metal were introduced by Vent-Axia.

• **1937** – A new plastic laminate for coating fan blades called Micarta, made fans quieter and less likely to corrode.

Over the decades, fans have evolved into aesthetic decorative pieces for homes apart from their cooling functions. They are available in different kinds of designs to suit the interiors. Some also have aesthetic lights to add the mystic ambience to your space. Moving away from switchboards and regulators, modern fans can also be controlled remotely.

## Common mistakes people make that leads to poor performance of the fan

### • Not thinking about where you’re placing your fan

If the air is cooler outside than inside – usually in the evenings – you can place your fan next to an open window, facing into the room, and it will draw cool air into your home.

### • Pre-cooling your room ready for sleep, or running your fan overnight

Running your electric fan in your bedroom to pre-cool your room before bedtime might seem like a good idea, but you’re actually just wasting energy. Fans don’t cool a room: they move air around, which helps cool your body. If you’re not in the room, there’s no benefit to leaving the fan on.

### • Forgetting to clean before setting your fan up for summer

As a fan circulates air around a room, any dust or pollen that’s in the air will be circulated too: not what you want if you suffer from allergies. Like any other object, fans can gather dust when not in use – the built-up dust will be circulated round the room when you switch the fan on.

### • Choosing the wrong type of fan

Desk fans are designed to be placed on a desk or table. A desk fan will cool you down if you’re right next to it, but it won’t create a strong breeze – otherwise it would be blowing all your papers about. A pedestal or tower fan stands on the ground, and is designed to cover a whole room.
